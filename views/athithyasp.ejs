    <p>
        When conditioning a dog to increase fitness, consistency is key. It is better to take a 20-minute walk every day than a 2-hour walk on Sunday. A slow, steady increase in time and intensity helps avoid injury and is more comfortable for the dog. For dogs that require additional challenges, you can advance to more intense activities, like field trialing, flyball, or agility competition.

        Whatever the ultimate fitness and exercise goals for your dog, allow common sense basics to guide you. Get your veterinarian involved to provide medical input and then get going! Your dog will thank you.
